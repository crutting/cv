I currently research modeling population needs based calculations of health workforce requirements. I'm also very involved with research into how to build a knowledge graph of public, private and restricted government data sets specific to health workforce to better inform public health policy planning.

I've spent the last three years serving on the board of the National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers. Previous to that I served on the Salt Lake City Planning commission for 8 years. 

I've participated as a grant reviewer with HRSA annually for the last 10 years.

I'm highly interested in exploring systemic interconnectivity and its affects on our communities, social services and our health care system. Our society is very good at tracking and auditing financial transactions and measuring wealth. We are quite poor at tracking and auditing other types of transactions that measure things like health, well being, stability and anti-fragility. Luckily, our financial transaction systems also track information about each transaction. Companies use this data to plan their decisions. Databases for financial transactions with the government exists for all sorts of purposes. However these data sets are frequently siloed and walled off from one another for political reasons. By connecting these silos we can create a knowledge graph of government data sets that is highly specific to any given subject we have questions about. As an example take health care license records that exist and are managed at the state level in every state. These license files can be matched to unemployment insurance records to describe health care provider employment. They can also be connected to health care insurance claims records, tax records, education records all maintained by various departments within a state government. They can also be connected to records from private health systems for further value added.
