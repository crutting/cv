## [Utah Mental Health Workforce 2021](http://umec-shiny-prod-alb-79075571.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/projects/Mental_Health/)

- Analysis of a survey I designed and administered to all LCSWs, CMHCs, MFTs and Psychologists licensed in the state of Utah. I coded initial examples of charts and layout for my team to build out. I coded the projection model section of the report 


## [National Nursing by the Numbers Dashboard]( https://clarkruttinger.shinyapps.io/draftboard/)

- I coauthored the analysis of the [NCSBN 2020 National Nurse Sample Survey](https://www.journalofnursingregulation.com/article/S2155-8256(21)00027-2/fulltext). Once the report was released I designed and coded this flexdashboard from the data grouped by reported state of employment for each survey respondent.

## [RN Data Analysis in R](https://rpubs.com/crutting/DesNewsAnalysis)

- An RMarkdown analysis of RN wage data in Utah from 2015 to 2020 from surveys I conducted in those years of the Utah RN Workforce. Analysis conducted for an investigative report in the Deseret News in Utah.
