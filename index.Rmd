**My goal is to advance my understanding of the interconnectedness of healthcare and health systems through Health Services Research/ Informatics and Data Science.**

-   Currently interested in how states leverage transactional data produced by every state government (ie: professional licensing records, [SWIS](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/swis), [SLDS](https://www.ecs.org/state-longitudinal-data-systems/) and [APCD](https://www.apcdcouncil.org/) etc...) to build interconnected information systems that can inform health policy planning at the state and regional level and be rolled up to a system that informs national health policy in better ways than the current methods of using national sample surveys and siloed, disconnected data sets.

-   I am architecting an information system within the Utah state government that can interconnect all available data sources from both public/ state government and private sources into a [knowledge graph](https://medium.com/@timo.klimmer/what-the-heck-is-a-graph-database-cd92ae041b5a) specific to improving health workforce policy analysis for stakeholders within the state of Utah including the state legislature, education and health system administrators.
