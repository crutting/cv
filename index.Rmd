I started my career as an [Americorps](https://americorps.gov/) member working for the [Wasatch Homeless Health Care, Fourth St. Clinic](https://fourthstreetclinic.org/) in Salt Lake City Utah. At the time, I was intended to pursue a career in the foreign service or international development with USAID. I worked for a humanitarian aid NGO in Peru as an undergrad and I was preparing to take the foreign service exam and apply for graduate school, when my wife and I had our first child. 

This little baby was a life changing event in more ways than expected. We found out at 18 weeks gestation that the fetus had signs of [Spina Bifida](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/spinabifida/facts.html#:~:text=Spina%20bifida%20is%20a%20condition,not%20close%20all%20the%20way.) on the ultra sound. We didn't know what this really meant other than that we needed to consider the needs of our growing child. We were at the beginning of a journey that required me to learn the ins and outs of our health insurance system. We were offered the option to participate in a randomized control trial study of [Prenatal versus Postnatal Repair of Myelomeningocele](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1014379) being conducted by the NIH. The results were later published in the New England Journal of Medicine and found that Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele resulted in better neurologic function than repair deferred until after delivery. We were assigned to participate in the study at the [Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/). We flew to Philadelphia, and after a week of informed consent meetings, we were accepted into the trial and randomized to receive in- utero surgery. At 25 weeks gestation, my wife and child were operated on. Her uterus was opened and drained of amniotic fluid. A neurosurgeon operated on the fetus to repair as best he could the open lesion and tuck nervous tissue back into the still growing body of the fetus. The amniotic sac was then refilled with [Lactated Ringers](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/016679s104,016682s105,016692s095,019367s026lbl.pdf) and stapled closed. My wife then spent the next 5 months on bedrest at the [Philadelphia Ronald McDonalds House](https://www.rmhcphilly.org/) going weekly to CHOP for ultrasounds by the study team.  
 

My goal is to advance my exploration of pursuing further graduate studies in Health Services Research/ Informatics. I'm very interested in how states leverage data that is produced in every state such as professional licensing records, SWIS, SLDS and APCD etc... to build interconnected information systems that can inform health policy planning at the state and regional level and be rolled up to a system that informs national health policy in better ways than the current methods of using national sample surveys and siloed, disconnected data sets. 

By way of a more detailed further introduction of myself. I am the Director of Workforce Research for a small entity within the Utah state government, called the Utah Medical Education Council (UMEC). We are charged to advise the healthcare industry on workforce education and practice trends. We collect and analyze supply, education and demand data about the state's health workforce. My work here has allowed me to study health workforce policy issues on the state and national level for the last 12 years. I came to this work with a great deal of past experience in healthcare policy work. I started my career in health policy with Americorps service for a year as a care coordinator at the local homeless health care clinic here in Salt Lake City way back during the 2002 winter Olympics. I then spent a couple of years as the grant writer for a local homeless shelter. I went on to masters work in public administration with an emphasis in public budgeting and program evaluation while working as a medicaid/ welfare benefit analyst. Almost 5 years ago now I finished an MBA with a focus in information systems while working as an analyst for my current employer. 

The underlying persistent themes of my career over the last 18 years have been health policy and data analysis. I've helped build and manage a database of providers willing to volunteer and donate clinical services to homeless patients. I've tracked and queried medicaid eligibility policy data in support of administering state programs. The first work I was involved with at the UMEC was tracking GME allocation across residency programs in Utah for a CMMS demonstration project run by the previous director of the UMEC, David Squire. Who at the time was also serving on COGME. My current work, beyond the modeling project I am involved in with Dr Magill is focused on building an information system within the Utah state government that can interconnect all available data sources from both public/ state government and private sources into a knowledge graph specific to improving health workforce policy analysis for stakeholders within the state of Utah including the state legislature, education and health system administrators. 

As I've worked on improving access to health policy related data at the state level I've had the great opportunity over the last few years to participate in the national conversation around health policy, data analysis and interconnectivity. My team and I created an interactive projection of the IOM Future of Nursing goal of an 80% BSN prepared workforce using Utah data sources, based on the work of Joanne Spetz. I've participated actively in the AAMC annual workforce conference. I recently built a comparison analysis dashboard of Physician specialty population to provider ratios in Utah to AAMC national averages for 2010-2020. From 2018- 2020 I had the opportunity to serve on the board/ and as board president of the National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers. During that time I was able to engage in a project and discussions with colleagues in various states about how to collect, analyze and share information about the nursing workforce across the country. As part of my board service with the National Forum, I had the opportunity to coauthor the most recent NCSBN National Nursing Workforce Survey.  As a fun personal side project, after the survey analysis was published, I decided to build a simple data visualization of the data set from the survey, broken down by the state each respondent reported being employed in.  I am currently serving as a volunteer advisor to the HRSA funded Health Workforce Technology Assistance Center .  I'm also volunteering on the Academy Health, Health Workforce Interest Group Advisory Committee for 2021-2022.
