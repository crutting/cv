I am the Director of Workforce Research for a small entity within the Utah state government, called the [Utah Medical Education Council (UMEC)](umec.utah.gov). We are charged to advise the healthcare industry on workforce education and practice trends. We collect and analyze supply, education and demand data about the state's health workforce. My work here has allowed me to study health workforce policy issues on the state and national level for the last 12 years. In July of 2022 we will be merged with the new Utah Governor's Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as part of his [One Utah Roadmap](https://governor.utah.gov/2021/01/19/gov-spencer-cox-releases-one-utah-roadmap-a-plan-for-the-first-500-days-of-the-cox-henderson-administration/). I will become the Director of the Utah Health Workforce Information Center within DHHS.

I came to this work with a great deal of past experience in healthcare policy work. I started my career in health policy as an [Americorps](https://americorps.gov/) member working for the [Wasatch Homeless Health Care, Fourth St. Clinic](https://fourthstreetclinic.org/) in Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympics. I then spent a couple of years as the grant writer for a [local homeless shelter](https://theroadhome.org/). I went on to masters work in public administration with an emphasis in public budgeting and program evaluation while working as a medicaid/ welfare benefit analyst in Utah state government. Almost 5 years ago now I finished an MBA with a focus in information systems while working as an analyst for my current employer. 

My goal is to advance my exploration of pursuing further graduate studies in Health Services Research/ Informatics. I'm very interested in how states leverage data that is produced in every state such as professional licensing records, [SWIS](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/swis), [SLDS](https://www.ecs.org/state-longitudinal-data-systems/) and [APCD](https://www.apcdcouncil.org/) etc... to build interconnected information systems that can inform health policy planning at the state and regional level and be rolled up to a system that informs national health policy in better ways than the current methods of using national sample surveys and siloed, disconnected data sets. 

The underlying persistent themes of my career over the last 18 years have been health policy and data analysis. I've helped build and manage a database of providers willing to volunteer and donate clinical services to homeless patients. I've tracked and queried medicaid eligibility policy data in support of administering state programs. I have coordinated data collection and cleaning for submission of clean cost reports for GME allocation across residency programs in Utah. My current work is focused on advancing the work of an [IBM Healthcorps grant](https://www.ibm.org/initiatives/ibm-service-corps/csc-7) [I received in 2018](https://www.deseret.com/2018/11/4/20657880/utah-has-a-shortage-of-primary-care-physicians-this-task-force-is-teaming-up-with-ibm-to-fix-it) to build a [primary care workforce supply model](https://umec.utah.gov/team/) in comparison to population health needs. This work has lead me down the path of architecting an information system within the Utah state government that can interconnect all available data sources from both public/ state government and private sources into a [knowledge graph](https://medium.com/@timo.klimmer/what-the-heck-is-a-graph-database-cd92ae041b5a) specific to improving health workforce policy analysis for stakeholders within the state of Utah including the state legislature, education and health system administrators. 

As I've worked on improving access to health policy related data at the state level I've had the great opportunity over the last few years to participate in the national conversation around health policy, data analysis and interconnectivity. My team and I created an [interactive projection](https://umec-nursing.utah.gov/bsn-projections/) of the [IOM Future of Nursing](https://nam.edu/publications/the-future-of-nursing-2020-2030/) goal of an 80% BSN prepared workforce using Utah data sources, based on the work of [Joanne Spetz](https://nepincollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spetz-2018-BSN-80-percent-forecast.pdf) of the [Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies, University of California, San Francisco](https://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/philip-r-lee-institute-health-policy-studies).

I've participated actively in the [AAMC annual workforce conference](https://www.aamc.org/what-we-do/mission-areas/health-care/workforce-studies/meetings). I recently built a comparison analysis dashboard of Physician specialty population to provider ratios in Utah to AAMC national averages for 2010-2020. From 2018- 2020 I had the opportunity to serve on the board/ and as board president of the [National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers](https://nursingworkforcecenters.org/). During that time I was able to engage in a project and discussions with colleagues in various states about how to collect, analyze and share information about the nursing workforce across the country. As part of my board service with the National Forum, I had the opportunity to coauthor the most recent [NCSBN National Nursing Workforce Survey](https://www.ncsbn.org/workforce.htm).  As a fun personal side project, after the survey analysis was published, I decided to build a simple data visualization of the data set from the survey, broken down by the state each respondent reported being employed in. Check out my [projects](https://clarkruttinger.info/projects.html) page to view this work. I am currently serving as a volunteer advisor to the [HRSA funded Health Workforce Technology Assistance Center](https://www.healthworkforceta.org/about/expert-workgroup/). I'm also volunteering on the [Academy Health, Health Workforce Interest Group Advisory Committee for 2021-2022](https://academyhealth.org/professional-resources/interest-groups/health-workforce-interest-group/advisory-committee/page/health-workforce-interest-group-advisory-committee).
