-   I am architecting an information system within the Utah state government that can interconnect all available data sources from both public/ state government and private sources into a [knowledge graph](https://medium.com/@timo.klimmer/what-the-heck-is-a-graph-database-cd92ae041b5a) specific to improving health workforce policy analysis for stakeholders within the state of Utah including the state legislature, education and health system administrators.
